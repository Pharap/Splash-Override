# Splash Override

A very simple Minecraft resource pack that overrides the default 'splashes'

## Motivation

I was wondering if it was possible to override the built-in 'splashes' in Minecraft and apparently it is, so I decided to make a resource pack to try it out. Then I decided to upload that resource pack to GitHub in case anyone else was wondering the same.

(Also, if I ever forget how to do it myself, this will be a nice little reminder for me.)

## Process

I wrote the `pack.mcmeta` and `splashes.txt` by hand in Notepad++.  
I used GIMP to create the `pack.png`, and have included the corresponding `.xcf` file to make life a bit easier for others.  

In case anyone is wondering, the background is a gradient from `RGB(127, 127, 127)` to `RGB(191, 191, 191)`.  
Those numbers were chosen because `256 / 4 = 64`, `255 - 64 = 191` and `191 - 64 = 127`.  

## Licence

Everything in the repo is released under CC0, which means you can do whatever you want with absolutely everything in the repo, without even having to credit the original author. This applies even to countries (e.g. Germany) where the 'public domain' technically doesn't exist.

(The only thing you can't do is claim you made it, because technically that's still plagiarism even with a practically public domain licence.)
